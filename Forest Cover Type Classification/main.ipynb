    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "- **Precision**: High precision means that when our model predicts a specific forest type, it is highly likely to be correct. For forest management, this reduces the risk of incorrect resource allocation.\n",
    "- **Recall**: High recall ensures that we are correctly identifying the majority of actual covers for each type. This is critical for conservation efforts where missing a rare type could be detrimental.\n",
    "- **Stakeholder Value**: Real-time classification allows for automated mapping of vast forest areas using minimal cartographic data, significantly lowering the cost of environmental monitoring."
